# Group1-code-DQC-QSQI-Minor-
The code of different modules.

# AddFunctionDistr.py
This file contains the modular exponentiation module.

# DistributedFunctions.py
This file contains the code that determines the topology of the different qunatum computers and a module that handles all gates and keep track of each induvidual register.  

# mod_exp_example.py
Here is the exmaple how to use the AddfunctionDistr.py and DistributedFunctions.py to do the modular exponentiation

# shor_algorithm.py
The shor algorithm. Unfortunetly, to run the code on a backed takes much time. And we could not test the working of the code. That is why we commened out the part of the code to only generate the qunatum circuit.
